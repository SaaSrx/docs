# Docs

Ideally docs can be part of the functions and not an external repo.

Currently using mkdocs to deploy on github pages.

# Github actions

If using an organization make sure `Settings > Actions > General > Workflow Permissions` has `Read and write permissions` enabled as the default is not on.
